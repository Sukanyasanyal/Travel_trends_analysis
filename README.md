**Project Title: Global Travel Trends & Resilience Analysis ‚úàÔ∏èüåç**
This project delivers key insights into **global tourism resilience and flight price seasonality** using Python for robust data transformation and Power BI for impactful visualization.

### 1. Project Goal: Key Questions Answered
This analysis directly addresses the two critical business questions defined at the start of the project:

### Country Resilience: Which economic and societal factors correlate with a country's tourism resilience or recovery after a major disruption (e.g., the 2020 global events)?

### Travel Seasonality: What is the seasonal trend of international flight prices, and when are the most and least expensive times to travel?


### 2. Tools & Technologies Used

| Tool/Technology | Used For |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Google Colab (Python/Pandas)** | **Data Acquisition, Cleaning, Transformation, & Merging (ETL)**. This was the primary tool for cleaning and combining raw data into two final CSV files. |
| **Microsoft Power BI** | **Data Modeling, DAX, & Visualization**. Used for dashboard creation, final data modeling, and creating the `Visitor_Tier` column. |
| **Generative AI (ChatGPT & Gemini)** | **Troubleshooting & Debugging.** Used to assist in resolving complex coding and syntax errors encountered during the data cleaning phase. |

### 3. Data Sources & Usage (Updated for Reproducibility)

The project uses three primary raw data sources, but due to their size (over 45 MB each), two have been removed from this repository and must be downloaded separately.

| Source File (Raw Input) | Status in Repository | Purpose & Access Instructions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`Scraped_dataset.csv`** (47.5 MB) | **EXCLUDED** (`.gitignore`) | **Raw Flight Data.** Source for seasonality analysis. [Please download this file from its original Kaggle or external source.] |
| **`Cleaned_dataset.csv`** (48.0 MB) | **EXCLUDED** (`.gitignore`) | **Intermediate File.** This pre-cleaned file was ignored in favor of a custom cleaning and merging workflow. |
| **`World-happiness-report-updated_2024.csv`** (163 KB) | **INCLUDED** (in `data/raw`) | **Happiness Scores.** Used to enrich country metrics. |
| **`world_tourism_economy_data.csv`** (666 KB) | **INCLUDED** (in `data/raw`) | **Tourism/Economic Metrics.** Core file for resilience analysis. |
| **`World-happiness-report-2024.csv`** (13 KB) | **INCLUDED** (in `data/raw`) | **NOT USED**. An older version of the happiness report was ignored. |
|**`travel_master_country_data.csv`** (4 KB) | **INCLUDED** (in `data/cleaned`) | **Primary Resilience Data**. Custom merged file used to create the Power BI scatter plot and map. |
|**`flights_seasonal_cleaned.csv`** (1 KB) | **INCLUDED** (in `data/cleaned`) | **Primary Seasonality Data**. Custom aggregated file used for Power BI line chart and card. |


### 4. Technical Challenges & Solutions (Showcasing Problem-Solving)
The data pipeline presented several significant real-world challenges, which required specialized solutions:

### A. Initial Data Loading & Cleaning Errors (Python/Colab)
Challenge,Issue Description,Solution Implemented
**Unicode Decode Error**,"Attempting to use pd.read_csv() to view the head of the raw files resulted in a UnicodeDecodeError, preventing data inspection.",Resolved by specifying the correct encoding: added the parameter **encoding = 'latin-1'** to the pd.read_csv() function.
**Data Integrity Verification**,"The tourism data documentation was misleading (claimed data up to 2023, but was only complete through 2020).",Had to run a preliminary query on the raw file to accurately determine the last complete year (2020) before running the final data transformation script.
**Date/Format Mismatch & Kernel Issue**,"After initial cleaning, the **flights_seasonal_cleaned** file displayed **0 rows** due to a date format mismatch. This was followed by an unrelated **AttributeError** when converting a string to a numeric type.","Required professional debugging assistance (from **ChatGPT/Gemini**), a manual correction of the date format logic, and finally, restarting the Colab kernel to clear memory and cache before rerunning all scripts to successfully merge and export."

### B. Visualization Challenge (Power BI)

Challenge,Issue Description,Solution Implemented
**Faded Map Colors**,"The Filled Map visualization lacked a dedicated color saturation field, causing the default colors to appear faded and indistinct when mapping a numerical measure (like Visitors_2020).","Created a custom **"Visitor_Tier"** column using a **DAX formula** in Power BI to categorize resilience into nominal measures (e.g., 'High Resilience', 'Low Resilience'). Used this new categorical column as the Legend, allowing the manual selection of bright, high-contrast color palettes for a clearer visual analysis."


### 5. Project Findings (Questions Answered)
Key Question,Finding/Conclusion,Visual Confirmation
**Country Resilience**,"The **Scatter Plot** shows a strong relationship, where countries exhibiting a higher Happiness Score also demonstrated greater resilience (higher Tourism Revenue) during the 2020 disruption.",Scatter Plot (Tourism Revenue vs National Happiness)
**Travel Seasonality**,"The **Line Chart** clearly identifies periods of peak and trough travel cost, concluding that international flight prices are typically lowest in March(3), among Jan(1), Feb(2) and March(3).",Line Chart (Average Flight Price Seasonality)
